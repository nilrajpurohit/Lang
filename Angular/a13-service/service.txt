1.Service is a class which help to share same functionality,data,logic into multiple component.

2.Without service we can do by creating an object of a component but this is not reflexiable i.e after 
sometime that class take paramenter then you have to change in every file where you create an object of that class.

3.By service in angular you can override with parameter, means nothing to do with parameter.

4.Service have an @Injectable() decorate to make that service class accessable to other class,
Without Injectable that class will become an normal ts class.(have to create object every time).

5.Service can be inject in module or component.
but if you inject sevice in child compo then that service will only accessable to child's child compo
not to child's parent compo.

so the place is appCompo i.e root component to get accessable for all child component under that.

but the best place is to inject in appModule because your application start from that place i.e (RootModule).
under provider array.
